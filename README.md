# Weather API Integration
##  Description

This task implements integration with "WeatherAPI" to get data for the next day.

##  Goals

- Develop an application that interacts with the WeatherAPI.com API to retrieve the next dayâ€™s forecast for the cities of Chisinau, Madrid, Kyiv, and Amsterdam.
- Output the weather forecast to STDOUT in a table format, where rows represent cities and columns represent dates, including the following data points: minimum temperature, maximum temperature, humidity, wind speed, and wind direction.
- Implement API calls using a modern library such as Retrofit to handle requests and JSON responses, with clear and extendable data models.

## Set the API key as an environment variable
